# Visualize-PCA-Auto-encoder-And-K-Means-Clustering
code for Visualizing and Understanding the Relationship between PCA, Auto encoder and K-Means Clustering.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used technique
in the area of Unsupervised Dimensionality Reduction. In Unsupervised data Clustering, one of the popular technique is K-means
clustering. C Ding et al. proved that K-means Clustering can be
approximated as a super-sparse PCA. Authors also proved that that
the relaxed solution of K-means Clustering, specified by the Cluster
Indicators, is given by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Although PCA is not a Clustering method, it is generally used to reveal
Clusters. In General, both methods, PCA and K-means Clustering
are used together. This is because in case of higher Dimension data,
PCA helps in reducing the Dimension of data on which we can apply K-means Clustering to reduce Computation cost. In a nutshell,
we aim to establish the Relationship between PCA and K-means
Clustering along with needed proofs. Later we Visualise graphs,
for this established Relationship on IMDB Movie dataset. Later we
extend to Understand relationship between PCA and auto-encoder
i.e.., under what constraints PCA is equivalent to Auto encoder
using IRIS dataset.
